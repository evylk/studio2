# How the API works:
# - Creates a Sha1 hash of the users entered password
# - Slices the hash and sends the 5 first characters (prefix) to the API
# - API returns all found suffixes
# - Browser checks if the suffix is found in the response
#   - If suffix is found, returns amount times that password has been seen
#   - If suffix is not found, returns information that password was not seen in breaches


# Work to do:
# rewrite the feedback to the user


# Example:
# the password "mypassword" has the following hash: 91DFD9DDB4198AFFC5C194CD8CE6D338FDE470E2
# website sends 91DFD prefix to the api and gets a response with 1300 responsens.
# the suffix 9DDB4198AFFC5C194CD8CE6D338FDE470E2 is found in the response with a total of 120351 found
# this result is presented to the user
