PassPOWER - AI-Powered Passphrase Generator with Visual Memory Support

PassPOWER is a Flask-based web app designed to help users create secure, memorable passphrases using AI. It generates strong phrases, turns them into visual scenes using GPT and DALLÂ·E, and supports memorization through storytelling and image reinforcement.

How to Run the App:

1.Load your OpenAI API key into the terminal:

$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = YOUR_KEY_HERE

(Make sure your OpenAI account has credit. Generating images costs around $0.06 USD per round.)

2.Save the index.html file inside a folder called "templates", and make sure this folder is in the same directory as passpower_CHAT.py.

3.Run the Flask app by executing:

python passpower_CHAT.py

Open your browser and go to:
   
http://localhost:5000

5. Enjoy!
