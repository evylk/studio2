# How the API works:
# - Creates a Sha1 hash of the users entered password
# - Slices the hash and sends the 5 first characters (prefix) to the API
# - API returns all found suffixes
# - Browser checks if the suffix is found in the response
#   - If suffix is found, returns amount times that password has been seen
#   - If suffix is not found, returns information that password was not seen in breaches


# Work to do:
# rewrite the feedback to the user
